            <p>
            I'm a 1st year Computer Science student who holds intermediate certifications in UX/UI design and front-end web 
            development, which allow me to blend creativity with functional coding skills. I'm currently 
            pursuing the CompTIA A+ certification to strengthen my technical support and troubleshooting 
            capabilities, and I plan to pursue AWS certification to expand my knowledge in cloud technologies.
             I'm actively seeking an entry-level role that allows me to contribute across front-end development, or IT support and grow within a team that values innovation, learning, and cross-functional skills.
